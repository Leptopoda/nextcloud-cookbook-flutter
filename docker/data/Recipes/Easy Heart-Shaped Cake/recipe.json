Grease an 8-inch square pan and an 8-inch round pan. Line bottoms with parchment or wax paper. Grease paper and dust lightly with flour.\n","Beat white sugar, butter, vanilla, and almond extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until well combined.\n","Stir flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in another bowl.\n","Beat 1 cup dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined. Add 1\/2 cup milk; beat until combined. Continue adding 1 cup dry ingredients and 1\/2 cup milk, beating after each addition, until all are used and batter is smooth. Divide evenly between the prepared pans.\n","Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
